hQuery
=========

The query gateway is a web based application that provides the back end for executing queries. 

The query gateway which exposes a query API, accepts queries, runs those queries against the patient data,
and returns the results of the query back to the query composer.

Environments
------------
hQuery will run properly on OSX and various distributions of Linux

hQuery will also run on Windows, however, there are some minor limitations to functionality and performance.

Dependencies
------------
* Ruby = 1.9.3
* Rails >= 3.1
* MongoDB >= 1.8.1

Install Instructions
--------------------

Project Practices
-----------------

Please try to follow our [Coding Style Guides](http://github.com/eedrummer/styleguide). Additionally, we will be using git in a pattern similar to [Vincent Driessen's workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). While feature branches are encouraged, they are not required to work on the project.
